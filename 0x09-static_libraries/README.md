# C - Static libraries
This project looks at the concept of Static Library which is defined as a file containing a collection of object files (*.o) that are linked into the program during the linking phase of compilation.

The four phases of compilation are:
1. Pre-processing
2. Compilation
3. Assembly
4. Linking
